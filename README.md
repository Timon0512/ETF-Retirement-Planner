This is a Streamlit app that uses yfinance to collect stock/ETF data and determine the CAGR for past periods. The lowest of the CARGRs is then discounted again by a safety margin and is then used to determine a projection for future returns. 

You can select your own age, retirement age and a savings rate. The app then calculates your projected account balance at retirement. You can also specify a target value that you want to achieve. The app then calculates how high your savings rate must be to reach this target value.
